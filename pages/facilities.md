      The innovative 100 acre facility of Stonetree Farms, built with great attention to detail, has all the amenities a top level boarding/showing venue needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health and safety for both riders and horses is a priority in every area. The well maintained, various sized paddocks are constructed with sturdy oak fencing and have channels between them. This ensures horses can see each other but not become aggressive across fence lines. The aisles, stalls and tack areas are well lit with both artificial and an abundance of natural light and have rubber matting throughout. There are large wash/tack stalls with hot and cold water and slip free surfaces.

      The bright and comfortable 12×12 ft stalls each have sub-floor drainage and large protected exterior windows for ventilation. Feed and storage areas are separate from the main stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doorways, aisles and walkways are wide and easy to maneuver through. The barn has been constructed and maintained in an environmentally responsible way and all horse accessible stall surfaces have been finished with non-toxic linseed oil.

      Horses school in either the 140 x 250 ft outdoor sand riding ring, or the 80 x180 ft indoor arena. Both are professionally constructed, safe and have excellent footing and drainage. The indoor arena has abundant natural light, and is well lit for night riding.

      For a change of scene and to develop additional skills there are private hacking trails winding their way to Batteaux Creek.

      Stonetree Farms is also dedicated to the comfort of the rider. Patrons can relax in the cozy heated lounge and viewing area. These have been elevated and configured to provide an unobstructed view of each riding area. Extending from the lounge is a deck overlooking the outdoor sand ring. In addition, there is a secure tack room with individual lockers, facilities for storage and cleaning of tack, full laundry, heated washrooms and free wireless Internet throughout the facility.
